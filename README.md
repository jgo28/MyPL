# MyPL 

MyPL is a custom programming language written in Python that interprets files with mypl extensions by 
performing lexical analysis, type checking, and semantic analysis.

Features of MyPl include variable declaration, function declaration, and struct declaration. There are also built-in functions
such as print (prints out string), length (returns length of variable), reads (reads a string), and itos (converts an int to a string).

## Usage
In the same directory as files, run: `python3 hw7.py [MyPL file name]`

Ex. `python3 hw7.py test1.py`
